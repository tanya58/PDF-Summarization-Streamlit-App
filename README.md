# PDF-Summarization-Streamlit-App
PDF Summarization Streamlit App
With the rapid growth of digital information, reading and analyzing lengthy research papers, reports, and articles can be time-consuming. This project presents a PDF Summarization Streamlit Application powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), designed to generate concise and meaningful summaries of PDF documents.

Leveraging state-of-the-art transformer-based models, the application processes and extracts key insights from PDF files, providing users with a structured summary of the main ideas, methodologies, and conclusions. The intuitive Streamlit-based interface allows users to easily upload PDF documents and receive well-structured summaries in real time.

# Key Components
ðŸ”¹ Importing Required Libraries
The application starts by importing essential Python libraries, including Streamlit for UI development, LangChain for handling PDF files, and Transformers to utilize a pre-trained T5 model for summarization.

ðŸ”¹ Loading the Pre-Trained Model & Tokenizer
A T5 transformer model and its tokenizer are loaded from the Hugging Face library to perform text summarization. These components process input text and generate concise summaries while preserving the core information.

ðŸ”¹ PDF Processing & Text Extraction
A custom preprocessing function loads PDF documents using LangChain and splits them into smaller text segments. These segments serve as input for the summarization model, ensuring optimal performance.

ðŸ”¹ Summarization Pipeline
A summarization pipeline is configured with the pre-trained T5 model and tokenizer. It takes preprocessed text, applies the model, and generates a structured summary.

ðŸ”¹ User Interface with Streamlit
The application provides an intuitive Streamlit-based UI, allowing users to upload PDF files and process them for summarization.

ðŸ”¹ Application Workflow

Users upload a PDF document via the interface.
The document is displayed in the app, with the original content on the left and the AI-generated summary on the right.
Clicking the "Summarize" button triggers the summarization process.
ðŸ”¹ Rendering PDF in Streamlit
To enhance user experience, the displayPDF function converts the uploaded file into base64 format and embeds it within an HTML iframe, enabling in-app viewing of the PDF.

ðŸ”¹ App Configuration & Deployment
The Streamlit layout is set to wide mode using st.set_page_config, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience. The app runs as a standalone module (if __name__ == "__main__": main()), making it ready for deployment and usage.

The main functionality of this project is to allow users to upload any pdfs and any research papers  documents in PDF format (with a page range of 15-20 pages), process them, and generate a summarized version of the content. It leverages a pre-trained language model for efficient text summarization and Streamlit to provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface. Users can seamlessly upload research papers and obtain concise, well-structured summaries, making it easier to extract key insights from lengthy documents.
